# Advanced Building Blocks - Bubble Sort

> The purpose of this project is to consolidate the acquired knowledge of the Ruby programming language. For this, I used the Bubble Sort programming technique.

This web page was the first Ruby Programming Language Project of the Microverse curriculum.
In this project, I learned the importance of the ordering of elements in Programming languages and how Ruby can help us to achieve this task.

- [Unzip](http://www.e7z.org/open-zip.htm) the repository or just clone it using git or github.
- Grab the bubble_sort.rb file and open it on your favorite online code editor, for example [repl.it.](https://replit.com/)
- If you want to see the source code of the files located in my repository, you can do it through a [code editor of your choice](https://www.elegantthemes.com/blog/resources/best-code-editors), I recommend using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/), first, you must [install it by following these steps](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs), then you must [open the folder containing my repository in your local repository](https://thisdavej.com/right-click-on-windows-folder-and-open-with-visual-studio-code/#:~:text=You%20can%20now%20navigate%20to,with%20VS%20Code%E2%80%9D%20as%20well.) and [open each of the files](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved) to see their content.
- If you have any questions or problems about how to run this project, you can leave me a comment in the [issues section](https://github.com/aristides1000/Advanced_Building_Blocks_Bubble_Sort/issues) of this repository, I am more than willing to help you.
